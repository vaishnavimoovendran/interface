<h1>During the donation</h1>
<p>The donor's arm is cleaned with an alcohol prep pad, and a member of the donation team inserts a needle into a vein. The needle is brand-new and sterile.

The needle is attached to a collection tubing and bag, and the blood will flow into the bag until it is full.

According to the American Red Cross, a whole blood donation takes 8-10 minutes on average. If a person is donating a blood product, such as platelets or plasma, this process can take up to 2 hours.
</p>
<h1>After the donation</h1>
<p>When a person has finished donating blood, medical personnel will remove the needle or intravenous catheter, apply pressure with a cotton gauze, and place a bandage over the person's arm.
The donor will usually wait for 10-15 minutes before leaving, during which time they will be encouraged to eat and drink some refreshments.

After the donation, medical teams will take the blood and test it for potential blood-borne diseases. Examples of these include HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis.

The donating organization usually performs more than a dozen tests to ensure the safety of the donated blood.

Donated blood can only last for a certain time and must be used before it expires. As a result, blood banks and hospitals have almost a continuous need for donated blood.
